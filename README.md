# Would You Rather

Project created by Fabricio Brito 'from scratch' to demonstrate usage of React and Redux for the Udacity Course "React & Redux".

MaterializeCSS library was used to design the front end of the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The only file provided by Udacity for this project was the _DATA.js, that was stored under the 'utils' folder. It was edited only to include the avatar links.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the necessary modules and dependancies to run the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
